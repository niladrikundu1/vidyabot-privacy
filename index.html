    <p>Welcome — VidyaBot is an AI-powered learning companion designed to support students and teachers. We respect your privacy and created this policy to explain what information we collect, how we use it, and what control you have. This policy applies to all products and services provided under the name <strong>VidyaBot</strong>, including mobile apps, web apps, and offline functionality.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the minimum information required to deliver VidyaBot's services and to improve learning outcomes. Collected data falls into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & profile information</strong>: student name, grade, language preference, and teacher/class identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: timestamps, pages/screens visited, actions taken (questions asked, practice attempts, correctness), and device information (device type, OS version).</li>
      <li><strong>Learning records</strong>: question logs, progress metrics, skill-level histories, and teacher-assigned tasks or feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio & media</strong>: short voice recordings and images when submitted by the user (for ASR or image-based questions). These are used to transcribe and provide answers and may be stored temporarily or only locally depending on configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical logs</strong>: crash reports, network logs, and performance metrics to help us maintain the service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and personalize tutoring and practice content.</li>
      <li>Adapt difficulty and recommend next steps for students.</li>
      <li>Power teacher dashboards and classroom analytics.</li>
      <li>Improve models, search quality, and the overall service (aggregated and anonymized where possible).</li>
      <li>Provide customer support, and detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent or abusive behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With consent:</strong> when parents/guardians or teachers explicitly consent to sharing (for example, sharing records with partner schools or research partners).</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted third-party vendors (hosting, analytics, ASR/TTS providers, vector databases) who process data on our behalf under contract and only as necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> when required by law, or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Local & Offline Use</h2>
    <p>VidyaBot is designed to work in low-bandwidth settings. Some data (curriculum bundles, cached content, and short-term ASR/TTS artifacts) may be stored locally on the device. When configured for offline-first operation, learning logs are cached locally and synchronized to our servers only when connectivity is available. You can opt to restrict syncing to Wi‑Fi only.</p>

    <h2>5. Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain learning records and account data for as long as the account is active and for a reasonable period afterwards to support reporting and legal obligations. If you request account deletion, we will remove personal data from active systems and schedule anonymization or deletion from backups within 90 days, unless retention is required by law. Teachers and administrators can export class data prior to deletion.</p>

    <h2>6. Children & Consent</h2>
    <p>VidyaBot is primarily designed for students under the supervision of schools or parents. For students under the age of 18 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction), we require consent from a parent, guardian, or authorized school administrator before collecting personal data. Teachers and school administrators are responsible for obtaining necessary consents for students in their care.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data. Measures include encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS), access controls, and routine security testing. While we strive to protect data, no system is completely secure — please contact us immediately if you suspect a breach.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your personal data. To exercise these rights or to correct account details, contact us at the address below. Teachers and school admins may manage student data via the teacher dashboard and local export tools.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use minimal cookies and similar technologies for session management and basic analytics. If you prefer, you can opt out of analytics tracking in the app settings where available.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be stored and processed in servers located in India and other countries. Where transfers occur, we use standard contractual safeguards or other lawful mechanisms to protect personal data.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Significant changes that materially affect how we use personal data will be communicated to account holders via email or in-app notices.</p>
